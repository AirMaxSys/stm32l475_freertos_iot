/*
 * There is some confusion about whether and how to carry forward
 * the state of the pools.  Seems like original Fortuna does not
 * do it, resetting hash after each request.  I guess expecting
 * feeding to happen more often that requesting.   This is absolutely
 * unsuitable for pgcrypto, as nothing asynchronous happens here.
 *
 * J.L. Cooke fixed this by feeding previous hash to new re-initialized
 * hash context.
 *
 * Fortuna predecessor Yarrow requires ability to query intermediate
 * 'final result' from hash, without affecting it.
 *
 * This implementation uses the Yarrow method - asking intermediate
 * results, but continuing with old state.

 *
 * Original Fortuna uses 32 pools, that means 32'th pool is
 * used not earlier than in 13th year.  This is a waste in
 * pgcrypto, as we have very low-frequancy seeding.  Here
 * is preferable to have all entropy usable in reasonable time.
 *
 * With 23 pools, 23th pool is used after 9 days which seems
 * more sane.
 *
 * In our case the minimal cycle time would be bit longer
